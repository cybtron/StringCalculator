This is a demonstration of StringCalculator Kata in Objective C language.
Following is condition for this Kata:

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)
	a. The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty 
		string it will return 0) for example “” or “1″ or “1,2″
	b. Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers
	c. Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to 
		write tests you did not think about
	d. Remember to refactor after each passing test
2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
3. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
	a. the following input is ok:  “1\n2,3″  (will equal 6)
	b. the following input is NOT ok:  “1,\n” 
	c. Make sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid inputs for these katas
4. Allow the Add method to handle a different delimiter:
	a. to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line 
		that looks like this:   “//[delimiter]\n[numbers.]” for example “//;\n1;2″ 
		should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
	b. the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported
